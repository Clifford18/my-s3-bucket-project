# Deploy Static Website on AWS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps
  - You will create a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.
  - You will configure the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies.
  - You will speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.
  - You will access your website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.
